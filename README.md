# workspace-iot
Take your work to all devices seamlessly


Inspiration

In today's connected world we are always working and switching between different systems. We need these devices to communicate internally with each other and find out the device we are currently working on and push the work automatically to the current screen( Notification).

How it works

We follow a server client architecture by designing a master server which keeps a check on the state of all the clients and then push the state to the active nodes.

Challenges I ran into

The main challenge was to device a single modular way to get the latest state of current client.

Accomplishments that I'm proud of

Working on an idea which was really a necessity for me and get it actually working.

What I learned

I have learned about Linode servers and how to client server model to connect IOTs

What's next for WorkSpaceIOT

The idea of implementing voice calls and play all types of application to different devices
